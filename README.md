[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/krystof1119/deutschskript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/krystof1119/deutschskript)

Deutschskript is a bizarre Javascript/Typescript library which adds some functions and extends the language in some other ways, all of which in German. It is NOT MEANT FOR PRODUCTION USE.

#### What can I expect?
* a NULL constant, which is not null, but 0
* a wenn() function, which is an if statement but worse
* Much more, with everything actually being documented!
* Full typescript typings

## How to get docs
Clone the repo, run `yarn install` and `yarn run docs`
